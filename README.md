# MongoSchemaViz

MongoSchemaViz is an innovative tool designed to visualize MongoDB schemas and analyze their relationships. It provides a clear, interactive representation of your database structure, enhancing understanding and facilitating better database design decisions.

## üåü Features

- **Schema Visualization**: Automatically generate visual representations of your MongoDB schemas.
- **Relationship Analysis**: Infer and visualize relationships between collections, with optional AI-powered insights.
- **Collection and Field Filtering**: Easily navigate through your data structure.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for exploring your MongoDB architecture.

## üß† Why MongoSchemaViz?

MongoDB's flexible schema design is powerful but can lead to challenges in understanding the overall data structure, especially in large, complex applications. MongoSchemaViz addresses this by:

1. Automatically analyzing and visualizing your MongoDB collections.
2. Inferring relationships between collections, even without explicit references.
3. Providing a clear, visual representation of your data structure.

This tool is invaluable for teams working on large-scale MongoDB projects, during codebase onboarding, or when planning data structure changes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- A MongoDB instance (local or remote)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for enhanced relationship analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```code
https://github.com/Kimkykie/mongo-collection-visualizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```code
cd MongoSchemaViz
```

3. Install dependencies:
```

npm install
```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI and OpenAI API key (if using):
```code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. Run the development server:

```code
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
